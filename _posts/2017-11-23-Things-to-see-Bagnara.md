Bagnara is where the Italian wedding will take place. It is Carmelo's hometown and where he lived until 18yo, time when he moved to Turin. This is where his parents live.

Bagnara is quite small but well connected through the train station. It is not far from Reggio Calabria and from Lamezia Terme and their respective airports.


The town is well known for its sea...
