### Around Shiraz

Shiraz is surronded by beautiful natural and historical places including:
- Persepolis (Takht-e-Jamshid)
- Pasargadae
- Naqhs-e-Rusatm
- Margoon Waterfall
- The village of Ghalat including Ghalat Waterfall
- National Park of Bamou
- Maharloo Lake (Salt Lake)


Just outside Shiraz you can find the group of sites: the mausoleum of Cyrus (Pasargadae), the old city of Persepolis, and Naqsh-e Rustam an ancient necropolis from 330 BC.

For these you might want to organise a trip with a local guide or tour.
