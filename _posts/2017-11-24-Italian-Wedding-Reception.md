Follow [these directions](https://goo.gl/maps/gZXZidvZFMJ2) to get to the venue from the Church. You can find some parking space in front of the venue and on street `via Torrente Zagarella`, very close to the venue.


### &nbsp;
### &nbsp;
### The beginning
On arrival, the guests will be welcomed by the team of Villa Chiringuito. An alcoholic drink will be provided together with some other refreshments and nibbles while you await Paria and Carmelo's arrival.

Paria and Carmelo will take a few pictures during the trip from the Church to the venue and they will join the guests, thereafter.

At the venue, you will also find, waiting for you, the live band that will play  music throughout the lunch. Babysitters will be present  to entertain our little guests.

### The arrival of the couple
A toast on the beach in front of the venue will celebrate the arrival of Paria and Carmelo.

After that, the antipasti will be served and will open the lunch. A selection of delicacies will be available which include fish, vegetable, and meat options.

The antipasti are served buffet style. The team of the venue will be present to help you with the serving. Many dishes will be  cooked in front of you, so a short queue might form.



### &nbsp;
### &nbsp;
### The lunch
After the antipasti, the guests will move to the main hall. This will be a covered area just in front of the sea.

Each table will have a name and seats will be pre-assigned to guests. You will find your name on the table. We will communicate the name of your table in advance. The venue team manager will be able to assist you with finding your table.

The lunch will be served by the venue team  one table at a time, starting from the table of the couple. Drinks will be on the table, and a selection of wines will be served by the venue team, if you wish to have more drinks, do not hesitate to ask the waiters for more. The venue team will be at hand  to re-fill your wine and other beverages. If you particularly like a dish, the venue team will also be happy to provide a "bis" which in Italian means "second round".


The lunch will have some breaks to allow some music to be played and to allow people to enjoy a break between the dishes and dance if they wish.

### &nbsp;
### &nbsp;
### The sweet tooth's corner
After the lunch - the guests will move to the second area of the venue where they will be served gelato and other desserts.
This is right before Paria and Carmelo will cut the wedding cake, which will then be served to the guests.
In addition to desserts and the cake, small, round sweets called "confetti" will be available for you to bring back home. Small bags will be available, one per person to fill and keep as a "sweet" memory of the day.


### &nbsp;
### &nbsp;
### The party
After the cake cutting, e there will be time for some dancing and relaxing.
Later in the evening, the musicians will make way for a a DJ who will make everybody dance with some international, national and local music. "Tarantella" will be played which is the typical dance from the south of Italy. You can start practicing it in advance to be an expert on the day of the wedding!

At this time, the open bar will begin and serve a selection of five cocktails. Ask the bartender what is available.

Later on, for those who might still have space in their tummies,  there will be a nice Paella Valenciana (Valencia style) served.



### &nbsp;
### &nbsp;
### The return to Bagnara
The party will then continue until late. Transportation will be arranged for return to Bagnara, for all those who have requested via their submitted invitation form.

Looking forward to seeing you at our wedding!
