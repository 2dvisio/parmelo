# The Italian Wedding
We have outlined below important information about the wedding day. We request you to read this information carefully to help you better understand the sequence of events on the day of the wedding.

The Italian wedding is composed of two parts, the ceremony and the reception.

## The ceremony
### Time and location of the ceremony
The religious part of the ceremony will start at 11 a.m. and will last for an hour. The ceremony will be celebrated in a church in Bagnara.
Details are given below:
```
Chiesa S. Maria e i XII Apostoli

```

### During the ceremony
On the day of the wedding Carmelo, together with all the guests, will await the arrival of Paria inside the Church. It is important to be on time. You wouldn‚Äôt really want to miss the entrance of Paria while she walks down the aisle! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

The ceremony will be a Catholic Mass celebrated in Italian. We hope that you will still enjoy the beautiful ceremony, although only those who understand Italian will be able to follow.

Since the Mass is a religious ceremony, an appropriate dress code has to be adopted. Shorts cannot be worn, and women have to cover their shoulders, generally a shawl/light shrug will do just fine.

During the ceremony, it is customary that participants stand and sit according to the different prayers. When you hear the priest say "in piedi" that means that you will need to stand, while when you will hear "seduti" that indicates that you could sit down. However, it might be easier to just follow what others do. Sitting and standing is not mandatory for those who cannot or are not able to do so.

Towards the end of the ceremony, the priest will ask the participants to exchange a gesture of peace, in this case people will shake hands with whoever's near them. Don't be surprised. Do shake the hand of the people standing close to you.

The ritual of exchanging peace is soon followed by the ritual of the Holy Communion wherein, people attending the Mass leave their seats, go forward and queue to receive the Holy Communion from the priest. The Holy Communion is the bread that symbolises the body of Jesus Christ. If you are not Christian, you are not required to participate in the ritual of the Holy Communion. In that case, you can sit and enjoy the music played while the ritual is completed.

After the Holy Communion, there will be a final blessing by the priest, post which the ceremony will end. At this point Paria and Carmelo together with the witnesses will sign the wedding register.

This signature will mark the end of the ceremony. Everybody can then exit the church and wait outside until the newlywed couple exits.

### After the ceremony
After the ceremony when the couple will be coming out of the Church, rice will be thrown at the newlyweds. This is to symbolise a shower of fertility.

Following that, all guests approach and congratulate the couple outside the Church.

Photographers will take a couple of photos with all the guests right at the entrance of the Church.

People will then start to head towards the venue where the reception will take place and the celebration will continue.
