There are many ways of reaching Bagnara Calabra.

The best and easiest way to get here is by flying to either Lamezia Terme or Reggio Calabria airports.

If you reach Lamezia Terme, a bus to the train station is available at the exit of the airport (on the right side close to a kiosk/bar). Once at the train station, trains for Bagnara run almost every 1h. Make sure that you book a train that stops in Bagnara, otherwise you might need to change either in Villa S. Giovanni (actually further South then Bagnara) or Rosarno (between Lamezia and Bagnara). Trains that serve Bagnara's station are quite frequent, so make sure you select one of those.

The first train is usually around 5am, and the last around 9pm. The regional, direct train costs around 7.40€. You can pay at the till of the station or get an e-ticket online [here](http://www.trenitalia.com/tcom-en). If you select Lamezia Terme Aeroporto as initial station, the price of the bus ticket will be included, otherwise the ticket onboard costs 2€.

If you reach Reggio Calabria, a free bus is available to bring you to the train station, the bus stop at the airport is marked with a sign (as visible [here](http://www.aeroporticalabria.com/infrastrutture-reggio-calabria/collegamento-stazione-ferroviaria-aeroporto-aerostazione/)).
Instructions on how to book a train ticket are similar to the ones for Lamezia Airport. Also in this case, make sure that you book a train that stops directly in Bagnara.


Another airport close to Bagnara is the one of Catania in Sicily, if you opt for this solution you will also need to cross the Sicily-Calabria channel. Ferries run almost every 30 minutes between Messina and Villa S. Giovanni, renting a car is the best option in this case.
