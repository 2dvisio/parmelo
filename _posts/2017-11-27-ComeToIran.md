The best way to reach Shiraz is via **Shiraz International Airport**.

Both Turkish Airlines, Qatar Airways, and Emirates are the most frequent airlines serving this airport with stops in Istanbul, Doha, or Dubai.

Alternatively you can fly to one of the below international airports:

- Tehran IKIA
- Isfahan IFN
- Tabriz TBZ
- Mashhad MHD

If you plan on arriving at any of the above airports you might need to transit from the international to the domestic airport as they are not always in the same location.

You can organise your domestic flights using the [Mahan Air](http://www.mahan.aero/en) website.
