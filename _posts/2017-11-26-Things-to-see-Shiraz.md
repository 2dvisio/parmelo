### City of Shiraz

Shiraz is one of the oldest cities of ancient Persia most likely around 4000 years old. The earliest references to the city goes back to around 2000 BC. Capital of the Fars province and located in southwest, Shiraz is the third populous city of Iran.

Shiraz is known as the city of poets, literature, wine (despite Iran being an Islamic republic), and flowers. It is also considered by many Iranians to be the city of gardens, due to the many gardens and fruit trees that can be seen in the city.

The crafts of Shiraz consist of inlaid mosaic work of triangular design; silver-ware; pile carpet-weaving and weaving of kilim, called gilim and jajim in the villages and among the tribes.
