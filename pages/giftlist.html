    <p>
      We’ve been together now, more than a year or two,<br/>
      We really don’t need anything old or new.<br/>
      But if you really want, to help us on our way,<br/>
      Some money in a card, would truly make our day!
    </p>
    <p>
      We just got our home, filled it with plenty of stuff,<br/>
      Books, sofas, curtains, pots, we’ve certainly got enough!<br/>
      Instead of more wine glasses, we’d really love some cash,<br/>
      So we can book our honeymoon, and head off in a dash.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order for us to make our lovely dreams come true,<br/>
      We’d love to get a campervan and tour for a month or two.<br/>
      We’ve created a bank account to save your contributions,<br/>
      We appreciate your help towards our trip resolution!
    </p>
