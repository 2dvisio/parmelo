      <p>We will host an aperitivo on the 13th evening from 8pm onward at Carmelo's parents house: Via Malarbì, 8 - 89011 Bagnara Calabra.</p>
      <p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/h3w1zBVEphP2">Here is a link to a map of the area.</a></p>

      <p>The house will look like in the picture:

      </p>

      <p>The aperitivo is an informal gathering and so casual clothes are perfectly fine.</p>
      <p>The aperitivo is a snack-based dinner where nibbles (e.g. pizza, arancini, charcuterie) are served alongside drinks.

      <p>This will be an opportunity for you to make new friends and meet with some of the guests.</p>
      <p>The church is situated just next to the house, so it will be an opportunity to locate the area before the wedding day.</p>

      <p>The church in normal days would look like in the picture, however, unfortunately the façade of the church is currently still under restoration and will be covered.
