      <p><b> Transport from the Church to the Venue (Villa Chringuito):</b></p>
      <p>We have planned your trip from the church to the venue with a Bus which will be available in front of the church right after the ceremony and after we have taken the group photo.
          We have three representative who will make sure that everybody gets on board and no one will be left behind:

          <ul>
            <li><i>Gizelle Noronha</i></li>
            <li><i>Alex Fulger</i></li>
            <li><i>Stephanie Pieri</i></li>
          </ul>

      <p>As the road in front of the church is narrow, please help with the boarding by making sure that you board as soon as the bus stops in front of the church.</p>

      <p><b> Transport from the Venue (Villa Chringuito) to Scilla & Bagnara</b>:</p>
      <p>There will be three times which you can select to return.
        <ul>
          <li>8 p.m.</li>
          <li>10 p.m.</li>
          <li>1 a.m.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        <p>Each bus will leave sharp at the above mentioned times. We have selected three drop off points which you choose from based on where you are staying:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stop 1: Scilla, close to Hotel Palazzo Krataiis</li>
          <li>Stop 2: Bagnara, close to Palazzo Mediterraneo</li>
          <li>Stop 3: Bagnara, close to Grand Hotel Victoria</li>
        </ul>


        <p><b>How to organise your return trip:</b></p>
        <p>When you enter the venue there will be a list of all tables and the people who sit at each of them (ask Paria or Carmelo if you do not see the list). Next to this there are three A3 pages (one for each bus time) with a table where you can fill in your preferences.</p>

        <p>Based on your preference you can decide when to return. All you need to do is just to fill the form (there will be markers available).</p>
        <p>The list for each specific return (i.e. 8 p.m, 10 p.m and 1 a.m.) will have the capacity of 14. If the list is full you will need to fill in the next available transport list.</p>

        <p>If we have more than 14 guests left for the last return we will organise the extra return/s which will be at 1.30 a.m.</p>

        <p>We will hand the list over to the driver so that he knows which are the stops. He will call your name at the stop so please make sure that you get off at the right stop.</p>

        <p>In case of emergency regarding the return transport, please call Nima Babr (Pariaâ€™s Cousin): +46706687604 who can help you further.</p>

        <p>We hope that you will have a pleasant stay while in Bagnara and that you will enjoy the sea and the wedding.</p>
