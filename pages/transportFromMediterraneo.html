      <p><b> Transport from the Complesso Mediterraneo to the Church:</b></p>
      <p>
        We have organised a bus at 10.30am from in front of the main door of the apartment to bring you to the church.
        There is not much space on the street for the bus to wait and the bus cannot stay long and will leave at 10.30am sharp.
        Please make sure that you are in front of the apartment main gate at the latest by 10.25 so that you do not miss the bus.
      </p>
      <p>If you miss, you can still walk to the church which is 20 minutes walk.</p>

      <p>As the road in front of the apartments is narrow, please help with the boarding by making sure that you board as soon as the bus stops in front of the apartments.</p>
