  We have planned to have an adventure like this for so long! A trip which can connect both our hometowns.😊

<p>
    A campervan, us, and the world to explore. We would love one day to own a campervan and tour the world. However, we might need to rent it for now and to make this trip work.😄
</p>
<p>
  The route at the moment is just indicative, as you can imagine this trip will certainly require some planning!
</p>
<p>
  We would like to make this trip as soon as possible and in the warm spring months so that we do not face challenges like snow or the extreme summer heat.
  Anything to make our adventure a little bit stress-free.
</p>

<p>
  Along the trip we will pass through many places, cities, and countries.
  Among these: Italy, Greece, Turkey, Iran, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria.
  We will round trip and come back.
